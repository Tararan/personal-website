      Hi!
        `,
      `
        I am Ivo Jurišić and I am a frontend developer from Zagreb curently working for Emakina.
        `,
      `
        I am a curious person by nature and a nerd by definition, 
        which is something you will probably notice when you scroll through my CV. I am also really bad at writing about myself,
        which is something you will notice instantly.
        `,
      `
        Even though I am a developer and I enjoy writing code, I have strong people skills (if I may say so myself). 
        For example, I worked in a couple of industries which deal directly with people, like sales and later leading of a sales team, 
        and as a Restaurant specialist in Oldenburg, Germany. On the note of Germany I currently hold A2 certificate from 
        Croatian Chamber of Trades And Crafts
        `,
      `
      I was also a voulunteer on conventions like SFeraKon, Istrakon, Lifeline and many others.
       On topic of SFeraKon, in 2018 I was invited to be one of its organizers in the role of a leader of 
       volunteers (which was quite interesting experience and I learned a lot about leadership through that but you can read more about it in Personal skills section)
       and I will be returning next year in the same role.
